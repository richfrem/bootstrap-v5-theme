//richfrem forked copy of bootstrap-v5-theme repository: src/scss/_common.scss

// Remove these @import and @use statements for Bootstrap partials.
// They should be included by bootstrap-theme.scss or bcgov.scss higher up the chain.
// @import "/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
// @import "/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
// @import "/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";
// @use "~bootstrap/scss/functions" as *;
// @use "~bootstrap/scss/variables" as *;
// @use "~bootstrap/scss/mixins" as *;

// Use @use for local imports (like variables) and use a relative path
@use "./variables" as *;

// Keep the other existing content of _common.scss below this.
// This file should assume Bootstrap functions/variables/mixins are available from higher up.
// Based on the content you previously uploaded, there might not be much else here initially.
