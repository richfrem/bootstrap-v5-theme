// Use @use rules, all at the top

// Use @use with ~bootstrap alias for the main Bootstrap entry point
// This brings in all of Bootstrap's components, variables, functions, and mixins
@use "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap" as *;

// Use @use with relative paths for local theme partials
// These files will now have access to Bootstrap variables, functions, and mixins.
// Ensure all necessary theme partials are @use'd here
@use "./variables" as *; // Added/Ensured _variables is @use'd here
@use "./common" as *;
@use "./overrides" as *;
@use "./additions" as *;
@use "./fonts" as *;


// Keep any other styles that might exist directly in bootstrap-theme.scss below the @use rules.
// Based on the content you previously provided, it looks like this file only contains imports,
// so you likely don't have anything else below the @use block.
