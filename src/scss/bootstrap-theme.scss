// Main theme entry file using @use
//version 1.0.08
// Use @use rules, all at the top

// First, import the specific mixins needed for validation
@use "~bootstrap/scss/mixins/breakpoints" as *;  // Contains _assert-ascending mixin

// Then use @use with ~bootstrap alias for the main Bootstrap entry point
// This brings in all of Bootstrap's components, variables, functions, and mixins to this scope.
@use "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap" as *;

// Use @use with relative paths for local theme partials
// These files will now have access to Bootstrap variables, functions, and mixins
// (depending on how they are @use'd within each partial).
// Ensure all necessary theme partials are @use'd here.
// Order can sometimes matter for variable overrides.
@use "./variables" as *; // Use theme variables (which now @use Bootstrap variables)
@use "./common" as *;
@use "./overrides" as *;
@use "./additions" as *;
@use "./fonts" as *;

// Keep any other styles that might exist directly in bootstrap-theme.scss below the @use rules.
// Based on the content you provided, it looks like this file only contains imports,
// so you likely don't have anything else below the @use block.
